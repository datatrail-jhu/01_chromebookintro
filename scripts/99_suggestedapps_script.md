In the last lesson we discussed how to find web apps through the Google Play store. Here, we'll go step-by-step through how to download a web app. We'll then discuss a number of helpful web applications 

To download a web app, return to the Google Play Store as described in the previous lesson by clicking on the circle icon at the bottom left-hand side of the screen and then clicking 'Play Store' from the menu that pops up. Alterntively, you can use the Search bar to search for Google Play if the 'Play Store' icon is not immediately visible.

Once the play store pops up, you'll type the app that you're interested in downloading in in the search bar at top.

For this first example, we'll have you download Inbox by Gmail. Inbox is a standalone web-app that makes reading and organizing all of your email simple, right on your Chromebook. By typing 'inbox' in the search bar and hitting 'enter', a new window will pop up. 

The first result at the top should be Inbox by Gmail. There will be a green box that says 'INSTALL.' Click on this button to begin app installation.

In that same window, your browser will let you know that the app is Installing. 

When installation is complete, a green box will appear. Click on the green 'OPEN' button to open the Inbox app.

At this point, Inbox will open, and the Inbox icon will appear in the bar along the bottom of your screen. The Inbox app has now been downloaded! You can explore this app further now to see how it works if you'd like!

Now that Inbox is downloaded, it will be available every time you log in. To access it, just click on the circle icon at the bottom left of your screen

This will pop up the most recent apps you've used. If Inbox is among these icons, click on it now to open it. Or, you can use the search bar to search for the app you're looking for.

Now that you know the process for downloading a web application on your Chromebook, there are a number of other web applications that you may want to download to your Chromebook. We'll discuss what each of them is briefly here and give you a link to read more about that web application. None of these apps is essential, but they may be helpful for productivity or organization. These apps can all be accessed directly from your Internet browser, but sometimes it will make your life and work easier to have the app directly on your Chromebook.The apps discussed below can all be installed using the same process as you used above to install Inbox from Gmail.

We've previously discussed Slack as a place where you and all your other team members can communicate about projects. You can chat, share documents, read past conversations, and receive notifications on Slack. Having the Slack app on your Chromebook will allow you to be updated whenever anyone on the team is trying to communicate with you. 

Google Calendar is a great place to keep track of meetings and life events. We'll discuss the ins and outs of Google Calendar in a later lesson; however, for now, it's important to know that there is a standalone app for Google Calendar.

Wunderlist is a list-making app. It is somewhere you can make to-do lists for work and grocery lists for at home. You can access these lists on your Chromebook or your smartphone. These lists can be shared with others from the app and tasks on to-do lists can be delegated to there. Additionally, it has reminder capabilities so that you never forget someone's birthday or to take out the trash.

The Twitter app has all the same information as the Twitter website. It has the same tweets, news, and messaging capabilities; however, with it directly on your Chromebook, it makes accessing this information a little easier. 

Evernote is an app that can help you get and stay organized. It is primarily a place where you can take notes. However, it also allows you to generate to-do lists, organize receipts and bills, and to share these things with others. 

V L C is a multimedia player. It will play most types of video files. So, if you ever have a video that you're not directly streaming from YouTube, V L C will most likely be able to open and play it.

To delete an app from your Chromebook, you'll first click on the circle icon at the bottom left-hand side of the screen. This will open up your apps screen. Within this screen, you'll scroll to the app you'd like to remove. If, for example, you wanted to remove Google Docs, you would use two fingers to click on that icon. 

This brings up a menu where you can click on "Remove from Chrome..."

A new prompt will pop up asking you to confirm that you want to remove this app. If you do want to remove the app, click "Remove".

In this lesson we've covered how to download and delete web applications and discussed a number of web applications that will likely be helpful to you as you learn more about data science and get more familiar with your Chromebook.
