1. In previous lessons we have discussed how to download apps from the Chrome Web Store. Here we will discuss some Chrome web apps that may be useful for the course and where you can get them. None of these apps is essential, but they may be helpful for productivity or organization. These apps can all be accessed directly from your Internet browser, but sometimes it will make your life and work easier to have the app directly on your Chromebook. 


2. We've previously discussed Slack as a place where you and all your other team members can communicate about projects. You can chat, share documents, read past conversations, and receive notifications on Slack. Having the Slack App on your Chromebook will allow you to be updated whenever anyone on the team is trying to communicate with you. You can get Slack from either the Chrome Web Store or from the Google Play Store if your Chromebook runs Android. 


3. Google Calendar is a great place to keep track of meetings and life events. We'll discuss the ins and outs of Google Calendar in a later lesson; however, for now, it's important to know that there is a standalone app for Google Calendar. You can get this app from the Google Play Store.


4. Wunderlist is a list-making app. It is somewhere you can make to-do lists for work and grocery lists for at home. You can access these lists on your Chromebook or your smartphone. These lists can be shared with others from the app and tasks on to-do lists can be delegated to thers. Additionally, it has reminder capabilities so that you never forget someone's birthday or to take out the trash. You can get Wunderlist from either the Chrome Web Store or from the Google Play Store if your Chromebook runs Android. 


5. The Tweetdeck app has all the same information as the Twitter website, but it is organized to make it easy to use multiple accounts. It has the same tweets, news, and messaging capabilities; however, with it directly on your Chromebook, it makes accessing this information a little easier. You can get Tweeetdeck from the Chrome Web Store.


6. Evernote is an app that can help you get and stay organized. It is primarily a place where you can take notes. However, it also allows you to generate to-do lists, organize receipts and bills, and to share these things with others. You can get Evernote from either the Chrome Web Store or from the Google Play Store if your Chromebook runs Android. 

7. DataCamp will be used for tutorials throughout this sequence. You can install the DataCamp Chrome App which will provide a link to the DataCamp website. This app will be useful as a shortcut to DataCamp when doing assignments. You can get DataCamp from the Chrome Web Store.


8. DocHub can be used to upload documents, edit them, and sign them. When you need to apply an electronic signature to a document you are working on DocHub is useful. You can get DocHub from the Chrome Web Store. There are lots of other useful apps and as we go through the courses we will point out when there are apps that may be useful to help you speed your way through your work as a data scientist.
