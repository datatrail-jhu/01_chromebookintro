# Chromebook Applications

At this point, you may have realized that in many ways your Chromebook works just like any other laptop or desktop computer you've ever used. However, you may have noticed a few differences. Specifically, we've done everything so far on the Chrome browser. We haven't used any software that save data directly to your computer. This is because there is not a lot of memory actually on the Chromebook itself. That's not to say you'll be limited in what you can do as a data scientist. Rather, your work will be done in the cloud, rather than on your Chromebook directly. Also, while you won't be downloading software directly to your Chromebook, you can personalize your Chromebook in a manner similar to what you may have previously done on a laptop or desktop computer. On a Chromebook, this is done through Chromebook Applications, or Chromebook apps.  

### What is a Chromebook app?

Similar to apps on your phone or that are advertised on television and radio ("There's an app for that!"), Chromebook apps are downloaded from the Internet. These applications are referred to as web apps. There are many types of applications. They can be used to increase your productivity, help you plan your taxes, or entertain you, among many other things. To get started, Chromebook apps can specifically be searched from your Chromebook, by first clicking on the Launcher button on the bottom left-hand side of the screen.

This brings up a menu where you can select 'Play Store.'

The first time you click on 'Play Store' will bring you to the Google Play Terms of Service. After reading the Terms of Service, click on 'Agree' in the bottom right-hand side of the window.

The following window will ask you to accept the Google Play Terms of Service. Here, you will click 'ACCEPT' to get to Google Play's apps.

You now have access to Chromebook apps. In the next lesson, we will discuss a number of apps that you may want to add to your Chromebook. They will all be accessed through this screen.
