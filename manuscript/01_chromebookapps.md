# Chromebook Applications

Your Chromebook is a little different than most normal Desktop computers. The main difference is that almost everything will be done in a Chrome web browser. "Apps" for your Chromebook are mostly going to be links to websites where you can use software. For the most part, we won't use any software that save data directly to your computer.

That's not to say you'll be limited in what you can do as a data scientist. Rather, your work will be done in the "cloud", rather than on your Chromebook directly. Also, while you won't be downloading software directly to your Chromebook, you can personalize your Chromebook in a manner similar to what you may have previously done on a laptop or desktop computer. On a Chromebook, this is done through Chromebook Applications, or Chromebook Apps.  

### What is a Chromebook app?

Similar to apps on your phone or apps on a normal Desktop computer, Chromebook Apps let you do specific tasks on your Chromebook. Rather than downloading these apps to your computer, you will set up links to the websites on your Chromebook. 

These applications are referred to as web apps. There are many types of applications for a whole range of tasks, just like on your phone or a normal computer. They can be used to increase your productivity, help you plan your taxes, or entertain you, among many other things. To get started, Chromebook apps can specifically be searched from your Chromebook, by first clicking on the Launcher button on the bottom left-hand side of the screen.

This brings up a menu where you can select 'Play Store.'

The first time you click on 'Play Store' will bring you to the Google Play Terms of Service. After reading the Terms of Service, click on 'Agree' in the bottom right-hand side of the window.

The following window will ask you to accept the Google Play Terms of Service. Here, you will click 'ACCEPT' to get to Google Play's apps.

You now have access to Chromebook apps. In the next lesson, we will discuss a number of apps that you may want to add to your Chromebook. They will all be accessed through this screen.

Once you have installed an app you can find it by again clicking on the Launcher button on the lower left hand side of the screen.

If you don't see it among the first set of apps if you click on the arrow at the bottom of the screen you will be taken to a large list of apps installed on your Chromebook.

Your "shelf" is the set of apps that are viewable on the bottom of your Desktop. You can "pin" an app to the shelf by clicking with two fingers (sometimes called right clicking) on an app and then hovering over "Pin to Shelf" and letting go. For example you might want to pin your "Folder" with your local files to your Shelf so you can easily access it.

You will then see the app on your Shelf so you can click on it to be taken directly to that Chrome App.

If you want to "Unpin" or remove an App from your Shelf you should right click on the app on the Shelf, hover over the Unpin command and let go. The App will then be removed from your shelf.
