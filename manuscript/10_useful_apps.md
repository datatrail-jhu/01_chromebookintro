# Useful Applications

In previous lessons we have discussed how to download apps from the Chrome Web Store. Here we will discuss some Chrome web apps that may be useful for the course and where you can get them. None of these apps is essential, but they may be helpful for productivity or organization. These apps can all be accessed directly from your Internet browser, but sometimes it will make your life and work easier to have the app directly on your Chromebook. 


### Slack

We've previously discussed Slack as a place where you and all your other team members can communicate about projects. You can chat, share documents, read past conversations, and receive notifications on Slack. Having the Slack App on your Chromebook will allow you to be updated whenever anyone on the team is trying to communicate with you. You can get Slack from either the Chrome Web Store or from the Google Play Store if your Chromebook runs Android.

### Google Calendar

Google Calendar is a great place to keep track of meetings and life events. We'll discuss the ins and outs of Google Calendar in a later lesson; however, for now, it's important to know that there is a standalone app for Google Calendar. You can get this app from the Google Play Store.

### Wunderlist

Wunderlist is a list-making app. It is somewhere you can make to-do lists for work and grocery lists for at home. You can access these lists on your Chromebook or your smartphone. These lists can be shared with others from the app and tasks on to-do lists can be delegated to thers. Additionally, it has reminder capabilities so that you never forget someone's birthday or to take out the trash. You can get Wunderlist from either the Chrome Web Store or from the Google Play Store if your Chromebook runs Android.

### Tweetdeck

The Tweetdeck app has all the same information as the Twitter website, but it is organized to make it easy to use multiple accounts. It has the same tweets, news, and messaging capabilities; however, with it directly on your Chromebook, it makes accessing this information a little easier. You can get Tweeetdeck from the Chrome Web Store.

### Evernote

Evernote is an app that can help you get and stay organized. It is primarily a place where you can take notes. However, it also allows you to generate to-do lists, organize receipts and bills, and to share these things with others. You can get Evernote from either the Chrome Web Store or from the Google Play Store if your Chromebook runs Android.
