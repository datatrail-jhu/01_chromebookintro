# Updating your Chromebook

In computing, there are often updates that are available. Updates can fix bugs, add new features, and/or improve security on your chromebook. Over time, your apps will need to be updated as well as your Chromebook's operating system (OS) itself. To update your Chromebook you only need two things:
1. A Chromebook
2. An Internet Connection

In fact, every time you power on your Chromebook, it will check for and apply available updates. In fact, some updates to the Chrome OS happen in the background automatically while you're using your device with the updates going into effect the next time you restart. However, should you ever need or want to manually update your Chromebook, you can do so using the following steps:


### Steps to Update

**Step 1**. Click on your username or photo at the bottom right-hand of the screen.

**Step 6**. The progress of your update will be displayed in that window. Once the update has finished, a message will display letting you know that you are "Nearly up to date!" To complete the update, you will have to restart your Chromebook. To do so, click 'RESTART' at the right of the window.

At this point, your screen will go black for a few seconds. Your Chromebook will then restart and you'll be brought back to the login screen. Login back in here using your Google username and password.
