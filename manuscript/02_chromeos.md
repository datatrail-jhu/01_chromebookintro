# Chrome OS

Your Chromebook is a little different than most normal Desktop computers. The main difference is that almost everything will be done in a Chrome web browser. For the most part, we won't use any software that saves data directly to your computer with a few small exceptions.

When using a "normal" computer you usually download software that makes it possible to edit files, make presentations, use your calendar, or use social media. On a Chromebook there are three different ways that you can add new software to use. 

* __Chrome Apps__ - Are apps that you "add" to Chrome. The user interface is just the Chrome Browser. Very often these apps are actually just a link to a website that lets you do something like manage your calendar or write a document. But sometimes they have other offline functionality. 
* __Chrome Extensions__ - These are actually pieces of software that modify the way the Chrome Browser itself works. An example would be an ad blocker that prevents ads on webpages you visit in Chrome from being shown. 
* __Android Apps__ - Many modern Chromebooks now support installing Android Apps. These are the same apps that you would get if you had an Android phone. These apps won't run inside of a web browser, but will function just like an app on your phone. 

You can think of all three of these extensions to Chrome OS as "Apps". Not all Chromebooks support Android Apps and we want anyone to be able to complete the Chromebook Data Science Program if they have a Chrome web browser and an internet connection. So we will mostly focus on Chrome Apps and Extensions for this course. But if you have Android Apps that you like on your phone and have a [Chromebook that supports Android Apps](https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-chromebooks-can-run-android-apps) then you can add on to what we teach here. 

### Chrome "Apps"

Chrome Apps are software programs that run in the web browser. They can be as simple as a link to a website where the app runs or they can be actual pieces of software that download and run on your local Chrome computer. 

When you set up your Chrome OS account and log in there will be a number of Chrome Apps that are available to you by default. Some of the most useful ones are: 

* __Google Docs__ -  for creating, writing and editing formatted text documents (similar to Microsoft Word, but through the web browser)
* __Google Slides__ - for creating, writing and editing presentations (similar to Microsoft Office, but through the web browser)
* __Google Sheets__ - for creating, writing and editing spreadsheets (similar to Microsoft Excel, but through the web browser)

We won't go into too much detail about each of these apps here as we will cover that in a future class. For now we are just going to cover how to find these apps on your Chromebook, how to install and uninstall new ones, and how to organize them on your Chromebook. 

### Where do Chromebook Apps live? 

When you log into your Chromebook for the first time you can see icons for some apps at the bottom of the screen. This set of apps that are visible from the main screen are called your "Shelf". There is also a button in the lower left hand corner called the Launcher Button that looks like a circle. 


Once you have installed a Chrome App or Android App you can find it by by clicking the Launcher button on the lower left hand side of the screen. 


If you don't see it among the first set of apps if you click on the arrow at the bottom of the screen you will be taken to a large list of apps installed on your Chromebook. 

Another way to open the screen with your apps is to click on the Launcher button on your keyboard. On most Chromebooks this is a button that looks like a magnifying glass. 

Once you have found the App you want to open, click on it. When you click on a Chrome App the Chrome Browser will open up and be directed to the website where that piece of software lives. For exampele if you click on the Google Docs icon (the blue piece of paper) then you will be directed to the website: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/ which lets you edit and work with your Google Docs. 


### The Shelf

Your "Shelf" is the set of apps that are viewable on the bottom of your Desktop. You can use your Shelf to provide easy access to the Chrome Apps that you use most often. That way you don't have to remember the exact web address for your most frequently used websites. 


You can "Pin" an app to the shelf by clicking with two fingers (sometimes called right clicking) on an app and then hovering over "Pin to Shelf" and letting go. For example you might want to pin your "Folder" with your local files to your Shelf so you can easily access it. 

![Pin an app by right clicking](images/01_chromebookapps/01_gettingstarted_chromebookapps-10.png)


You will then see the app on your Shelf so you can click on it to be taken directly to that Chrome App. 

![The app is now pinned to your shelf.](images/01_chromebookapps/01_gettingstarted_chromebookapps-11.png)


If you want to "Unpin" or remove an App from your Shelf you should right click on the app on the Shelf, hover over the Unpin command and let go. The App will then be removed from your shelf. 


You can actually add any website you want to your shelf, not just the ones that have Chrome Apps. For example, we will be using http://rstudio.cloud for a lot of the work in this course. There is not a Chrome App for http://rstudio.cloud. But you can still add this website to your shelf. 

You can do this by first navigating to the website you want to add. Then clicking on the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the Chrome Browser. This will open up a menu and you can move yur cursor until it hovers over _More Tools_. Then you can move your cursor over _Add to shelf..._ and let go. 


This should then open up a window where you can name the website you are linking to. Click _Add_ to put the icon onto your shelf. 

Once you are done you will see an icon for http://rstudio.cloud on your shelf so you will be able to quickly navigate to this web app in the future. 



### Getting Chrome Apps

Chrome Apps are pieces of software that can be run from the web browser. Sometimes you will need to download and install them on your Chromebook and sometimes they will just be an icon with a link to a particular website that lets you do some function. 

We already talked about how you can To install a new Chrome App you need to use the Google Web Store. 


That's not to say you'll be limited in what you can do as a data scientist. Rather, your work will be done in the "cloud", rather than on your Chromebook directly. Also, while you won't be downloading software directly to your Chromebook, you can personalize your Chromebook in a manner similar to what you may have previously done on a laptop or desktop computer. On a Chromebook, this is done through Chromebook Applications, or Chromebook Apps.  

### What is a Chromebook app?

Similar to apps on your phone or apps on a normal Desktop computer, Chromebook Apps let you do specific tasks on your Chromebook. Rather than downloading these apps to your computer, you will set up links to the websites on your Chromebook. 

These applications are referred to as web apps. There are many types of applications for a whole range of tasks, just like on your phone or a normal computer. They can be used to increase your productivity, help you plan your taxes, or entertain you, among many other things. To get started, Chromebook apps can specifically be searched from your Chromebook, by first clicking on the Launcher button on the bottom left-hand side of the screen.

![Home Screen](images/01_chromebookapps/01_gettingstarted_chromebookapps-3.png)

This brings up a menu where you can select 'Play Store.' 

![Play Store](images/01_chromebookapps/01_gettingstarted_chromebookapps-4.png)

The first time you click on 'Play Store' will bring you to the Google Play Terms of Service. After reading the Terms of Service, click on 'Agree' in the bottom right-hand side of the window.  

![Google Play Terms of Service](images/01_chromebookapps/01_gettingstarted_chromebookapps-5.png)

The following window will ask you to accept the Google Play Terms of Service. Here, you will click 'ACCEPT' to get to Google Play's apps.

You now have access to Chromebook apps. In the next lesson, we will discuss a number of apps that you may want to add to your Chromebook. They will all be accessed through this screen.

Once you have installed an app you can find it by again clicking on the Launcher button on the lower left hand side of the screen. 

![Click on launcher window to view apps](images/01_chromebookapps/01_gettingstarted_chromebookapps-8.png)

If you don't see it among the first set of apps if you click on the arrow at the bottom of the screen you will be taken to a large list of apps installed on your Chromebook.
