# Where Are Files Stored?

Chromebooks are sold with the basic idea that you will store everything in the cloud. And, throughout this course, we'll stick to this principle. However, there _is_ local storage on your Chromebook. There's not a lot of it, so we will want to store all of your Docs, Slides, and Sheets on Google Drive; however, you should be aware of where you can find files stored locally on your Chromebook

### Where is the local storage?

Files stored locally on your Chromebook can be found by first clicking on the Launcher circle at the bottom left-hand corner of your screen.

To see all of the apps available on your Chromebook you will expand the selection from your Launcher by clicking on the '^' symbol on your screen.

This will expose a screen that looks similar to what you see below. The icons may be in a different order, but one of them will be a blue folder with the label 'Files.' Clicking on this will open up your 'Downloads' folder.

Here you will see anything you've downloaded from the Internet. Anything you save from the Internet, will make its way here.

Additionally, you'll notice that you also have access to all your files on the Cloud from this window. Everything in Google Drive is also available from your 'Files' directory.

### Determining how much storage is left

As mentioned earlier, there is a limited amount of storage on your Chromebook. To determine how much storage you have left, you can click on the three dots in the top right-hand corner of this screen. You will see how many gigabytes of space are still available on your Chromebook.

### Deleting and moving files

To delete something from your Downloads folder, select that file and then click on the trash icon along the top blue bar of the screen. This is one way to free up space from your Chromebook.

You can also move files from your local Downloads folder to the cloud by dragging a file and dropping it into 'Google Drive' along the left-hand side of the window. This will place a copy of the file onto your Google Drive in the cloud. However, the local copy on your Chromebook will still be there. You'll still have to go and delete the copy from your Downloads folder before the space on your Chromebook is freed up.
