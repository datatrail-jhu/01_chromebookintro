# Working offline

Chromebooks are primarily meant to be used with an internet connection. This is because most of the software you are using is through an Internet browser. So you will want to make sure you have internet access when you are working on your Chromebook whenever possible. 

But sometimes you won't have access to the internet. Fortunately, some of the Chromebook Apps and functionality are available offline. You can use these to work when you can't get an internet connection. Then your changes will appear online when you reconnect. 


### Editing text files

One of the most common things you might want to do when you don't have internet access is to just keep notes for yourself. There are a number of different apps you can do this. One useful choice is the _Stackedit_ App. _Stackedit_ is a Chrome app so you browse to it in the same way that you would any other Chromebook App. _Stackedit_ is available at the website https://stackedit.io/.
