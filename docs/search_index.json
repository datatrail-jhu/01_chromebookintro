The social connections created along the way will fuel job opportunities for scholars and foster a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive climate at the mentors’ institutions. "],["what-is-a-chromebook.html", "Chapter 1 What is a Chromebook?", " Chapter 1 What is a Chromebook? This course is part of “DataTrail”; however, it is not a required course in this Course Set. While not required for completion of the DataTrail course set on Leanpub, it may be very helpful to you! It’s not required because you don’t need a Chromebook to complete the courses. The only requirement for all of these courses is an Internet browser and connection to the web. However, if you have a Chromebook and want to get better acquainted with how it works, this course is for you! Chromebooks are a very specific type of computer produced by Google. Chromebooks aren’t exactly like normal computers and they have a few unique characteristics: They are usually very cheap They are designed mostly to use the web You don’t “install” any software on the computer itself Instead of “apps” and “software” you simply go to websites for your work A simple way to think about it is that a Chromebook is a computer that only lets you use an Internet browser like Chrome. You can’t really do much on the computer itself. Some people call this way of working - working only through the Internet - “cloud computing”. It’s called cloud computing because the computer you are using most of the time is not the one sitting in front of you. You are using the Internet to access tools and computers to do your work. But the physical computers doing the work are stored somewhere else - it could be nearby or on the other side of the globe. That is why people call the computers “in the cloud”. The goal of DataTrail is not that you have to use a Chromebook to finish the program, it is just that you could use a Chromebook to finish the whole program. You can finish the entire sequence of courses using any computer with an Internet connection and a web browser. Doing everything through a web browser has a couple of advantages for a training program like this: All Chromebooks have the same system so if you log out of one Chromebook and log onto another you will always see the same system (unless there has been an update to Chrome OS that affects all Chromebooks). Since everything is stored on the Internet (sometimes called “in the cloud”) then the Chromebook will always be set up with your preferences when you log off and log back on. Everyone is using the same software through the websites, so it reduces problems that come from different people using different versions of each computer program on different operating systems. Since Chromebooks are cheap and widely used, we expect many of the students who work on the class will use actual Chromebooks. In this course we will show you a little bit about how Chromebooks work, focusing on the Chrome OS operating system. If you are used to using a “normal” computer it can take a little getting used to to adapt to a Chromebook. A couple of things that you will likely do differently are: File storage: You won’t have much room for files on the computer itself, so you won’t store them on your laptop, you will store them on “the cloud” in Google Drive or Dropbox. Software: You won’t install any software on your local computer. You will instead make accounts on different websites or “web apps” that let you use tools through your web browser. For example you wouldn’t install a Twitter app on your computer, you’d browse to the Twitter website to use that software. If you restrict yourself to only working in web browsers, doing everything will feel a little weird at first. It is sort of like writing a Haiku - a type of poem with a very specific set of rules. When you first start writing these poems it can be difficult to remember the rules. But after you get used to it the rules begin to come much more naturally. In a similar way, using a web browser for everything becomes second nature after a period of “learning the rules”. Using Chromebooks to do data science is a relatively new idea and is only possible in the last few years. But increasingly the tools for doing data science are available through the web. It is more and more common to have to use the Internet to rent computers, do analyses, or distribute your results. So by learning to do data science on a Chromebook, you are preparing for a future where most analysis is done online. 1.0.1 Slides and Video What is a Chromebook Slides "],["chrome-browser.html", "Chapter 2 Chrome Browser", " Chapter 2 Chrome Browser A Chromebook is designed to primarily be an Internet browser. In other words, it mostly will only allow you to open up websites and navigate between them. Chromebooks use Chrome OS - this is like Windows on a Microsoft computer, Android on your phone, or OS X on your Apple computer. It is the main software that runs your computer. But unlike “normal” computers Chrome OS basically only allows you to use an Internet browser. Chromebooks use Google Chrome, Google’s Internet browser. When you are using a Chromebook, almost all of the time you will be interacting with the world through Chrome. When you have opened up your Chromebook you will see something like this. Chromebook opening screen The first thing you notice is that there is nothing on the “Desktop” and that all the “apps” are linked to from the bottom of the screen. This is called the “shelf” on a Chromebook. All the apps are basically just links to websites. To open a new Chrome Browser you can either click on the Chrome icon in the lower left of the screen or you can hold down the Ctrl key and press the n key. We write this combination of keys as Ctrl+n. If you do that you’ll see a new Chrome browser pop up. Chrome browser Here you can navigate to new websites and do all the usual things. At the bottom of the page are websites you visit frequently. In Chrome if you press the little square box (or boxes) in the top right hand side it will either maximize the size of a browser to fill the whole screen, or shrink it enough that you can drag the browser around. Chrome browser Click that box until the browser doesn’t fill the whole window. You can then create a second browser window by again using the Ctrl+n command. Multiple Chrome browsers If you want to do more than one thing at once you can do it in multiple windows like this. But it is often easier to see what you are doing if you use tabs instead of windows. You can close one of the browser windows by clicking the X in the upper right hand corner or by holding down Ctrl and pressing w. Closing a window With only one browser window open you can then open a new tab by holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the t key (we will call this Ctrl+t). Opening a new tab Now you can flip back and forth between tabs by clicking on the top of the tab in the browser. You can open more tabs by pressing Ctrl+t again. You can close them by pressing the x in the top right corner of the tab or pressing Ctrl+w. Closing a tab We’ll learn more about Chrome Apps later but for now if you press one of the other icons at the bottom of the screen then it will also open a Chrome window. The only difference is that it will go to a specific website for that icon. For example if you press the little blue paper icon you will open up a Google Doc. Open a Google Doc You can see that the Google Doc app is just another web browser but sent to a specific website - the website for Google Docs. Google Docs website Signing in to Chrome using your Gmail account automatically signs you in to all Google services including YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, and others. This is particularly useful since you don’t have to sign in to websites that use Google services when you go to them with your web browser. For example if you click on the Gmail icon - the envelope - on your shelf in the bottom left corner of the screen you’ll be taken to the Gmail website and then logged in to your account. You are already logged into Gmail when you log into your Chromebook If you open a second tab by again clicking the Google Docs icon on your shelf in the bottom left corner of your screen, you’ll have two tabs open. You can separate the two tabs into two different windows by clicking on the top part of the Google Docs tab and dragging the Google Docs tab away from the Gmail tab. You can drag to separate tabs You can also put two windows together into a single window with multiple tabs. To do this, click on the tab at the top of the Google Docs window and drag it until it is close to the tab for Gmail. When you let go both tabs will go together into a single window. You can drag to combine tabs into a single window Finally, if you want to keep track of websites you use frequently you can use bookmarking. You can “bookmark” pages that you visit regularly and Chrome will keep track of those websites for you. It’s especially helpful if you don’t want to type the full address of a webpage, visit a page frequently, or are afraid you will forget about a page you will need later. To bookmark a webpage in Chrome, simply click on the star in the address bar or pressCtrl+d on your keyboard. This will open the following window. Bookmark Menu If you click on “Done”, the bookmark will be saved to the Bookmarks bar. Next time you like to check the webpage you bookmarked without typing the address, you can click on the Chrome menu in the top-right corner, hover over Bookmarks, then click the bookmark you’d like to open. Bookmarks Those are the basics of how you manipulate windows and tabs in the Chrome browser. In the following lessons we’ll learn more about how you can use these windows to take advantage of the web through your Chromebook. 2.0.1 Slides and Video Chrome Browser Slides "],["chrome-os.html", "Chapter 3 Chrome OS", " Chapter 3 Chrome OS Your Chromebook is a little different than most normal Desktop computers. The main difference is that almost everything will be done in a Chrome web browser. For the most part, we won’t use any software that saves data directly to your computer with a few small exceptions. All this is not to say you’ll be limited in what you can do as a data scientist. Rather, your work will be done in the “cloud”, rather than on your Chromebook directly. When using a “normal” computer you usually download software that makes it possible to edit files, make presentations, use your calendar, or use social media. On a Chromebook there are three different ways that you can add new software to use. Chrome Apps: Are apps that you “add” to Chrome. The user interface is just the Chrome Browser. Very often these apps are actually just a link to a website that lets you do something like manage your calendar or write a document. But sometimes they have other offline functionality. Chrome Extensions: These are actually pieces of software that modify the way the Chrome Browser itself works. An example would be an ad blocker that prevents ads on webpages you visit in Chrome from being shown. Android Apps: Many modern Chromebooks now support installing Android Apps. These are the same apps that you would get if you had an Android phone. These apps won’t run inside of a web browser, but will function just like an app on your phone. You can think of all three of these extensions to Chrome OS as “Apps”. Not all Chromebooks support Android Apps and we want anyone to be able to complete the Cloud-based Data Science Program if they have a Chrome web browser and an Internet connection. So we will mostly focus on Chrome Apps and Extensions for this course. But if you have Android Apps that you like on your phone and have a Chromebook that supports Android Apps then you can install those apps as well as we discuss in the next section. 3.0.1 Chrome “Apps” Chrome Apps are software programs that run in the web browser. They can be as simple as a link to a website where the app runs or they can be actual pieces of software that download and run on your local Chrome computer. When you set up your Chrome OS account and log in, there will be a number of Chrome Apps that are available to you by default. Some of the most useful ones are: Google Docs: for creating, writing and editing formatted text documents (similar to Microsoft Word, but through the web browser) Google Slides: for creating, writing and editing presentations (similar to Microsoft Office, but through the web browser) Google Sheets: for creating, writing and editing spreadsheets (similar to Microsoft Excel, but through the web browser) Google Docs, Slides and Sheets are three Chrome Apps that come installed on your Chromebook We won’t go into too much detail about each of these apps here as we will cover them in a future class. For now we are just going to cover how to find these apps on your Chromebook, how to install and uninstall new ones, and how to organize them on your Chromebook. 3.0.2 Where do Chromebook Apps live? When you log into your Chromebook for the first time you can see icons for some apps at the bottom of the screen. This set of apps that are visible from the main screen are called your “Shelf”. The shelf is at the bottom of the screen Once you have installed a Chrome App or Android App you can find it by by clicking the Launcher button on the lower left hand side of the screen. If you don’t see the app among the first set of apps if you click on the arrow at the bottom of the screen you will be taken to a large list of apps installed on your Chromebook. You can click on the launcher button, then the arrow to see more apps Another way to open the screen with your apps is to click on the Launcher button on your keyboard. On most Chromebooks this is a button that looks like a magnifying glass. The keyboard launcher button looks like a magnifying glass Once you have found the App you want to open, click on it. When you click on a Chrome App the Chrome Browser will open and be directed to the website where that piece of software lives. For example if you click on the Google Docs icon (the blue piece of paper) then you will be directed to the website https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/ which lets you edit and work with your Google Docs. Clicking on the Google Docs icon will open Google Docs in the web browser. 3.0.3 The Shelf Your “Shelf” is the set of apps that are viewable on the bottom of your Desktop. You can use your Shelf to provide easy access to the Chrome Apps that you use most often. That way you don’t have to remember the exact web address for your most frequently used websites. You can “Pin” an app to the shelf by clicking with two fingers (sometimes called right clicking) on an app and then hovering over “Pin to Shelf” and letting go. For example you might want to pin your “Folder” with your local files to your Shelf so you can easily access it. Pin an app by right clicking You will then see the app on your Shelf so you can click on it to be taken directly to that Chrome App. The app is now pinned to your shelf. If you want to “Unpin” or remove an App from your Shelf you should right click on the app on the Shelf, hover over the Unpin command and let go. The App will then be removed from your shelf. The app is now pinned to your shelf. 3.0.4 Websites as Chrome Apps You can actually add any website you want to your shelf, not just the ones that have Chrome Apps. For example, we will be using http://rstudio.cloud for a lot of the work in this course. There is not a Chrome App for http://rstudio.cloud. But you can still add this website to your shelf. You can do this by first navigating to the website you want to add. Then clicking on the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the Chrome Browser. This will open up a menu and you can move your cursor until it hovers over More Tools. Then you can move your cursor over Add to shelf… and let go. Navigate to rstudio.cloud, move the cursor over More Tools, then Add to Shelf. This should then open up a window where you can name the website you are linking to. Uncheck the box that says Open as Window so that your Chromebook knows this is a website you want to open. Then click Add to put the icon onto your shelf. Uncheck Open as Window and click Add to add this website as an app. Once you are done you will see an icon for http://rstudio.cloud on your shelf so you will be able to quickly navigate to this web app in the future. The rstudio.cloud icon now appears on your shelf. 3.0.5 The Chrome Web Store and Chrome Apps Chrome Apps are pieces of software that can be run from the web browser. Sometimes you will need to download and install them on your Chromebook and sometimes they will just be an icon with a link to a particular website that lets you do some function. We already talked about how you can install any webpage as a Chrome App directly. But many Chrome Apps can also be found in the Chrome Web Store. This is a website that lets you search and find Chrome Apps for your Chromebook, similar to Google Play for Android Apps or the App Store for Apple apps. You can get to the Chrome Web Store by clicking on the launcher button, then finding and clicking the Web Store icon. Open the Chrome Web Store by clicking on the Web Store Icon. You will be taken to the Chrome Web Store in your browser. You can filter by whether they are free, built by Google, or are able to run offline. The first thing we will do is click on Apps to ensure that we are searching only among Chrome Apps. As an example we will find and install the StackEdit app, which is useful for writing markdown documents that you will use throughout the Cloud-based Data Science courses. One nice feature of StackEdit is that it can be used even when your Chromebook is offline. To find the app, we will search for StackEdit and then click return. Search for stackedit on the Chrome Web Store. This will show two options one as a Chrome App and one as a Chrome Extension. We will select the app version and click Add to Chrome. This will bring up a dialogue box that asks if you would like to add Stackedit. Click on Add and the app will be installed on your Chromebook. Click add to Chrome and then Add to add the app to your Chrome browser. You can then click the Launcher button in the lower left to see that the app has been installed. StackEdit is now installed. If you click on the StackEdit icon you’ll be taken to the app, which you can see is also run in the Chrome web browser, just like any website you would visit. The difference is that this website will let you write and save Markdown files. StackEdit runs in the web browser. 3.0.6 Chrome Extensions Chrome extensions are software programs that modify the way that the Chrome browser itself works. You can find and install them through the Chrome Web Store just like you can with Chrome Apps but they look and function slightly differently. Sometimes these extensions may do something very simple (like show you a funny picture when you open a new tab) or they might do something very important (like managing your passwords). As an example we will install the Pocket Chrome extension. Pocket is an extension that lets you save a particular website or essay for reading when your Chromebook is offline. So if you know you will need to read a document you can save it to Pocket before you are traveling somewhere where you will not have Internet access and then retrieve and read it even when you are offline. You can open the Chrome Web Store just as we did previously and search for Pocket under the Extensions window. Once you have found the extension you want, you can click on the extension and it will open a page where you can click on Add to Chrome if you do that and click add the extension will be added. Click Add to Chrome to add the Pocket extension. Chrome Extensions often show up as a small icon in the top right hand side of the Chrome Browser. You can click on the icon to bring up the Pocket extension - which will also come up as a web page in your web browser. The Pocket extension comes up as a web browser. If you sign up for the Pocket extension you can then navigate to a web page that you are interested in saving for later and click the Pocket icon in the top right hand side of the screen. Click the Pocket icon to save the webpage This will save the page for later so that you can read it offline. The page is now saved for offline reading Extensions, like Chrome Web Apps, can improve the way that Chrome OS functions in the same way that installing software on your local computer works. Extensions and Apps help you use your Chromebook to accomplish tasks that would not otherwise be possible. 3.0.7 Slides and Video Chromebook OS Slides "],["android-apps.html", "Chapter 4 Android Apps", " Chapter 4 Android Apps Android is an operating system that was made available by Google and now powers most of the mobile phones in the world. Android is not the same thing as Chrome OS even though the two systems are both produced by Google. Until recently the only kind of apps you could install on a Chromebook were Apps and Extensions as we discussed in the last section. But Google has started to support the use of Android Apps on a small but growing number of Chromebooks. If you have one of these Chromebooks it is now possible to use the same apps you use on your phone on your Chromebook. Android Apps are now available on Chromebooks Chromebook Apps are stored in the same place on your Chromebook as Chrome Web Apps and Extensions. In fact, just by looking at the Shelf or your list of Apps you won’t be able to tell which are Chrome Apps and which are Android Apps. So to get started, we do the same thing as we did in the previous section, click on the Launcher button to show a list of potential apps. You can again click the arrow to view more apps if the Play Store does not appear among the first set of apps Find the Google Play App The first time you click on ‘Play Store’ will bring you to the Google Play Terms of Service. After reading the Terms of Service, if you agree to the Terms click on ‘Agree’ in the bottom right-hand side of the window. Google Play Terms of Service The following window will ask you to accept the Google Play Terms of Service. Here, you will need to click ‘ACCEPT’ to get to Google Play’s apps if you agree with the Terms of Service. You must accept terms of service to install Android Apps This will bring up Google Play where you can install Android Apps. This is the same place you would go if you have an Android Phone and you were going to install an App on your phone. The Google Play Store We will install the Basecamp app that can be used for communication with teams and is frequently used by data scientists. First we search for the app in the Google Play Store. Search for the Basecamp App When you find the Basecamp app you will be taken to a page where you can click Install to install the app. You may be asked to agree to terms and Google Play may ask you to enter payment details. However, if you are only going to use free apps you can find the small grey Skip box and skip over entering this information. Once you install the app it will appear as any other app on your Chromebook. Install the Basecamp App However one key difference is that if you click on the Basecamp icon and open the app then you will see that it does not open in a browser window. Click on the Basecamp icon to open Basecamp Android Apps are not Chrome Apps so are not accessed through the web browser. In this case, they will open in a separate window. Even though they don’t open in a web browser, many apps, including Basecamp, still require an Internet connection to be fully functional. Others may be more useful when used entirely offline. The app is working in a window, but not a Chrome Browser 4.0.1 Slides and Video Android Apps Slides "],["chromebook-shortcuts.html", "Chapter 5 Chromebook Shortcuts", " Chapter 5 Chromebook Shortcuts When we discussed the Chrome Browser we learned a couple of keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts are combination of keys that make your Chromebook do certain functions. For example, if you hold the Crtl key and press the n key you get a new Chrome window. When we want to tell you to press this key combination we will use the symbols Ctrl+n to describe what you are doing. In our Chrome Browser lesson we taught you the commands: Ctrl+n - open a new Chrome window Ctrl+t - open a new Chrome tab Ctrl+w - close an open Chrome Window or tab Ctrl+d - this will bookmark a page There are in fact a large number of keyboard shortcuts. Depending on what you do most often with your Chromebook some may be more or less useful to you. Here we will highlight a few that we use frequently and will come in handy for you during your data science career. To understand these key combinations first it is useful to know what some of the symbols on your Chromebook keyboard represent. The arrows in the top left hand corner take you back to the previous webpage you visited in a Chrome Tab and forward to the next page you visited. We will call them the forward and back keys. The back and forward keys are the arrows in the upper left of the keyboard. The curly key next to that refreshes the page you are currently visiting. Sometimes if you make an update to a webpage you are building and want to see the update you will need to refresh the page. We will call this the refresh key. The refresh key is the curly key in the upper left of the keyboard. The full screen key will take a tab you are working on and make that tab fill the whole screen. This will hide your shelf and hide the bookmarks and search bar at the top of your screen. When working on coding or when you feel you don’t have enough screen space this button can be helpful. You can shrink the browser window back to the normal size by pressing the full screen button again. We will call this the fullscreen key. The full screen key is the key with the window with two arrows in the upper middle of the keyboard. The button next to that is the show all windows button. This button will show you all the windows you have open, including Chrome Windows and any Android Apps you might have open. We will call this button the showwindows button. The show windows key is the key with the window and two lines next to it in the upper middle of the keyboard. The screen lock key in the upper right hand corner will lock your Chromebook when you aren’t using it and if you set up your settings to require a password, then you will need to re-enter your password to re-open your Chromebook. When working on data science projects where the data is sensitive it is a good idea to lock your Chromebook whenever you aren’t using it. We will call this the lock key. The lock key is the key with the lock in the upper right of the keyboard. You will recall that the Launcher key is the key with the magnifying glass on the left hand side of the keyboard. We will call this the launcher key. The launcher key is the magnifying glass on the right of the keyboard. 5.0.1 Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook Using these keys we can now consider some of the more useful keyboard shortcuts on your Chromebook. This will definitely be a partial list, you can learn about the rest of the shortcuts from the Chromebook help documentation. One of the most useful things to know how to do is to be able to take a screenshot. You will use this when you are trouble shooting problems in the course frequently. There are two ways to take a screenshot. The first is to use the command ctrl+showwindows. If you use this key combination you will take a picture of everything that appears on the screen. This first will appear as a pop-up box in the lower right hand corner. The screenshot appears as a dialog in the lower right. You can also open the Files App and see that the screenshot has been stored on your computer. All screenshots you take will automatically stored in Files on your computer. The screenshot appears is stored in the Files App. If you click twice quickly on the screenshot file it will open and you can see it looks exactly like what was on your screen when you took the screenshot. The screenshot is a picture of whatever was on your screen. Sometimes, rather than taking a picture of the whole screen you will want to take a picture of just a small part of the screen. There is a second screenshot command that lets you do this. If you press crtl+shift+showwindows then your screen will turn a shade darker and you will see your cursor is replaced with a bullseye icon. If you click and then drag, you can select only part of your screen to take a screenshot of. For example you could take a screenshot of just the upper right hand corner of the Files App. A targeted screenshot is also stored as a png in the Files App. This screenshot also will pop up in the lower right hand corner of your screen and then appear in your Files App. A targeted screenshot only takes a picture of part of the screen. 5.0.2 Zooming in and out Another set of useful shortcuts is to zoom your screen in and zoom your screen out. To zoom in, you can hold down ctrl and press the key that has the plus and equals on it (near the top right hand side of the keyboard). To zoom out, you can hold the ctrl key and press the key with the minus and underscore key on it (near the top right hand side of the keyboard). This will allow you to make the text on websites bigger and smaller to ease reading. For example on the website https://rstudio.cloud/ if you press ctrl+plus/equals four times you will zoom in 175%. If you use the zoom shortcut the text on a webpage increases in size. 5.0.3 Finding a word on a page Sometimes you will need to search a webpage for a specific word or phrase. To do this you can press ctrl+f and a box will pop up. You can then search for the specific word, for example we could search for the word “teach” on https://rstudio.cloud/. You can find a word or phrase on a page using the find shortcut. 5.0.4 Text formatting shortcuts Many of the text formatting shortcuts are nearly the same as on other types of computers. We will review them briefly here as they will be very useful when editing documents, presentations, and code. If you have used computers before you may already know these. ctrl+c - copies selected text ctrl+v - pastes the selected text ctrl+x - cuts the selected text and copies it so you can paste it elsewhere ctrl+z - undoes the previous action you did when editing a file One thing that is somewhat unusual about a Chromebook is that there is not a caps lock key. If you want to turn on caps lock you will need to use the command alt+launcher. To turn caps lock back off again you can simply click on the shift key. 5.0.5 Slides and Video Chromebook Shortcuts Slides "],["where-are-files-stored.html", "Chapter 6 Where Are Files Stored?", " Chapter 6 Where Are Files Stored? Chromebooks operate on the basic idea that you will store everything in the cloud. And, this set of courses is designed with this principle in mind. So most files will be stored online and used through your web browser. There is not a lot of room to store files on most Chromebooks, so we will want to store all of your documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and data on Google Drive or Dropbox. There is local storage on your Chromebook where you can place files. For example, we saw that when you take a screenshot with your Chromebook the file is saved onto your Chromebook directly, not onto the cloud. This can be particularly useful when people send you a file in an email and you want to eventually store it online. You might need to download it first to upload it again to one of the online file storage systems. 6.0.1 Where is the local storage? Files stored on your Chromebook can be found using the Files App. You can find them by first clicking on the Launcher circle at the bottom left-hand corner of your screen. To see all of the apps available on your Chromebook you will expand the selection from your Launcher by clicking on the ‘^’ (up arrow) symbol on your screen. Launcher Screen You can then find the Files App which looks like a blue circle with a white file folder on it. As we discussed in a previous section you can pin this app to your Shelf by clicking with two finders, then moving the cursor over Pin to Shelf and letting go. It is important to pin this app to your shelf since it will be one of the apps you use most regularly. Pin the Files App to your Shelf. If you click on the Files App you will see all of the files you have downloaded from the Internet, any screenshots you may have taken, and any other files you have stored locally on your computer. The Files App shows you all of your files. These files are all stored in a folder called “Downloads” if you click on the Downloads button you will only see the files that are actually stored on your Chromebook. These files will be available whether you are connected to the Internet or not. The Downloads folder shows you all of the files on your Chromebook. One challenge is that most Chromebooks don’t have much space on them to store data and files. You can check how much space is left on your Chromebook by clicking the three dots on the upper right hand side of the Files app. The Files options lets you see how much storage you have left. Despite the limitation on local storage you can also store some of your files and data on the cloud. We will talk about different options for this depending on whether you are storing code, data, or other files later. But in general, you have access to all of your files stored on the “cloud” here as well. For example, everything in Google Drive is also available from the Files App. These files aren’t saved to your computer, they are saved on the Internet, so you will need an Internet connection to be able to access them. To see these files click on “Google Drive” on the left hand side of the Files App. Google Drive files can be accessed from the Files App If you want to free up space on your Chromebook, one thing that you can do is transfer some of your files from your Downloads folder to your Google Drive. You can do that by clicking on a file in your Downloads folder, holding down, and dragging it to Google Drive. This will upload the file to the cloud. You can drag files from Download to Google Drive to upload them. Then if you delete it from your Downloads folder, it will only be stored on the web and will free up space on your Chromebook. To delete a file you can click with two fingers on the file. This will bring up options for different things you can do with the file. If you move your cursor down to delete and let go, you will be asked if you want to delete the file. If you say yes, the file will be permanently deleted from your Chromebook. Click with two fingers on a file and then move the cursor over delete to rename the file. You might also find that the names of files aren’t easy to follow. In a later course we will cover file naming for data science. But for now, it is useful to know how to change the name of a file. You start by again clicking with two fingers on the file. Then you can drag the cursor over “Rename” and let go. Click with two fingers on a file and then move the cursor over delete to delete the file. This will place your cursor on the file name which will now be editable. If you type in the new name and hit return the file will be renamed. Type in the new name and hit return, but don’t change the extension. Usually it is a good idea to leave the file extension the same even if you rename a file. The extension is all of the characters after the period that tells your computer what type of file it is - a code file, a data file, a text file, or something else. For example if your file is named “file.png” then the extension is “.png”. So you might change the file name to something like “new_file.png” but you would want to leave the “.png” at the end. 6.0.2 Slides and Video File Storage Slides "],["working-offline.html", "Chapter 7 Working Offline", " Chapter 7 Working Offline Chromebooks are primarily meant to be used with an Internet connection. This is because most of the software you are using is through an Internet browser. So you will want to make sure you have Internet access when you are working on your Chromebook whenever possible. But sometimes you won’t have access to the Internet. Fortunately, some of the Chromebook Apps and functionality are available offline. You can use these to work when you can’t get an Internet connection. Then your changes will appear online when you reconnect. 7.0.1 Google Drive As we discussed in a previous section, the Files App shows files both from your Google Drive and in a “Downloads” folder. All the files in your “Downloads” folder are saved directly on your Chromebook and are available even if you aren’t connected to the Internet. But you can also store files on your Google Drive. The advantage of Google Drive is that all your files are stored online. This means they won’t be lost if you lose your Chromebook and will be accessible from any Internet connected computer. However, sometimes when you don’t have access to the Internet you may want to access your files offline. You can make Google Drive files available offline on your Chromebook. To do so you need to open the Google Drive App on your Chromebook. You can find the Google Drive App by opening the apps using the launcher button and clicking on the Google Drive icon. To confirm that you are set to work offline open the Google Drive App Once you have opened Google Drive you can open the Settings in the upper right hand corner. Open the Google Drive Settings Then you can confirm that the box is checked next to the “Offline” setting. This means that all of your Google Slides presentations, Google Docs text files, and Google Sheets data files will be available offline. This will use up storage on your Chromebook, but will let you work even when your computer is not connected to the Internet. Confirm that the setting to work offline is turned on 7.0.2 Example: editing a text file offline One of the most common things you might want to do when you don’t have Internet access is to write in a text file. You can do this with a number of different apps. But the one we will use most frequently is Google Docs. You will learn more about Google Docs in a future course, but for now we will show you how offline editing works. First, click on the Google Docs icon to open up the Google Docs App. Note you may have to click on the launcher window to find this App if it is not pinned to your shelf. When Google Docs is open you can click on the plus sign to create a new document. Open Google Docs and create a new document Now you should add some text by typing in the Google Doc, this text will automatically be saved on the Google Doc online. Add some text to the Google Doc online To test offline editing you need to turn off wifi on your computer. You can do that by clicking the avatar picture in the bottom right hand side of the screen to bring up your global options. Then you can click on the wifi connection to open up the wifi options. Open your wifi options You can turn off wifi and your Internet connection by clicking the dot at the top of the wifi menu. Now your Chromebook is offline. Turn off wifi by clicking the dot. Now you can open the Google Docs App back up by clicking on the Google Docs icon at the bottom of your screen. You can still make edits to the document created while you are offline. You can still edit the Google Doc offline. When you are working offline the offline icon will appear next to the file name. The offline icon appears next to the file name. When you are editing a file offline you will see that it says “All changes saved offline” at the top of the window next to the file name. This means that changes to your online document won’t happen until you reconnect to the Internet. Changes are not saved to the file on the Internet until you reconnect. To see how this works you can open back up the wifi menu and turn the Internet connection back on by again going through the menu opened by clicking on your avatar on the lower right hand side of the screen. Turn the wifi back on. Right after you turn the wifi back on you will briefly see that it says “Saving” at the top of the document next to the file name. This means that the changes you have made to the file are being saved from the version on your Chromebook to the version on the Internet. Changes are saved when you go back online. In a similar way you can also edit presentations and spreadsheets offline using Google Slides and Google Sheets. We will cover those Apps more in a separate course. One thing that is worth noting is that if you work with files offline, then the version you change will update the version of the file online. So if you have shared a document with someone else, when you edit that document offline and re-connect, it might write over some of their changes to the file. 7.0.3 Offline Apps In addition to the main apps from Google, many other apps and extensions offer Offline functionality. Some will be fully functional when they are offline and some will only partially work. When you open the Google Web Store you can specifically search for Apps that have offline functionality. But you will need to review each App to figure out what is available when you are online or offline. You can search for apps that say they have offline functionality. 7.0.4 Slides and Video Working Offline Slides "],["chromebook-security.html", "Chapter 8 Chromebook Security", " Chapter 8 Chromebook Security In some ways a Chromebook provides some security for you. Chrome OS has a number of security features that are constantly being improved by Google. We will discuss updating your Chromebook in a later section, but the updates ensure that at a basic level your Chromebook will have good security features. For example, data will be encrypted when passing through a web browser and each browser window will be sandboxed so a web app open in one browser window can’t access data from another window. But there are still some steps that you can take to make sure that your Chromebook is secure. This will be particularly important if your Chromebook is lost or stolen, but will also be useful if you share your computer with family or friends. Since a data scientist is often working with data that may be private or sensitive, it is important that if they lose their computer, they don’t risk losing the data they are working on. Setting your Chromebook up to be secure from the start is an important step for any data scientist. 8.0.1 Setting your Chromebook password One of the most important parts of securing your Chromebook is making sure that you have a good password. Good passwords are long, easy for you to remember, but hard for other people to guess. Don’t use simple passwords like “12345” or “password”, don’t use your name, your date of birth, or other details that would be easy to guess if someone saw your Facebook profile. Good passwords have a few important characteristics: They are long, ideally more than 10 characters They are easy for you to remember. They are not a commonly used password. One way to create relatively good passwords is to string together four or five random words. This approach was made popular by an xkcd cartoon. For example a password made with this approach would be “bikerainsmellblue”. This password has more than 10 characters, is easy for you to remember, and is unlikely to be used by a lot of other people. Try to pick words that aren’t related to each other. Then you only have to remember the four words to remember your password. xkcd suggested a good password combines four random words. Another way to create a password is to choose a line from a book or movie and choose the first one to three letters of each word. For example, you might use the line “Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,” then you could change that to “onupamiddrwhipoweanwe”. You can then just remember the line that you have chosen and the fact that you used a certain number of letters from each word. Again, its a good idea to pick a line from a poem or a book that is less famous to do this. You can improve either of those password schemes by capitalizing some letters or turning words like “too” into numbers to make them more unique. The key is just to have a password that is not very common, easy to remember, and would be hard for other people to guess. 8.0.2 Requiring password to wake from sleep Now that you have set a good password you can make your Chromebook more secure by making sure that anyone will have to use the password to log in. To do this you need to again open up your personal settings by clicking on your personal avatar in the bottom of your screen and then click on the gear to open your personal settings. Open your personal settings Once you have your personal settings open you can click on the “Screen Lock” settings. Open the Screen Lock settings. You’ll be required to input your (hopefully good!) password. Input your password. Then you can turn on screen lock by clicking the option in the upper right hand corner of the screen for “Show screen lock when waking from sleep”. Click on option to Show screen lock when waking from sleep. Now if you close your Chromebook, put it to sleep, or log out, you will have to input your password to get access to your account. This will prevent other users from getting access to your Chromebook account even if they get a hold of the physical device. 8.0.3 Managing other people Another thing that you can do to make your Chromebook more secure is decide in advance who can log into your Chromebook. To do this, open your personal settings by clicking on the personal avatar at the bottom right hand side of your screen, then click the gear to open your personal settings. The click on the option to “Manage Other People”. Click on Manage Other People to manage users of your Chromebook. If you are the owner of the Chromebook you can then click on the dot next to “Restrict sign-in to the following users”. If you are the owner of the Chromebook will then be able to input which users can and can’t log on to your computer. Click on the option to restrict users. 8.0.4 Two step verification If you are dealing with very sensitive data or want to be more secure about who can access your account, you can turn on two step verification. All this means is that you can set it up so that entering your password is not enough to unlock your computer. You will also need to get a text message to your phone with a special code each time that you log in. This means that even if someone gets ahold of your Chromebook, they would also have to have your phone to be able to log into your account. Two step verification is often required for data scientists working in industry and is a good idea to prevent loss of your account information. To turn on two step verification first go to the website https://www.google.com/landing/2step and click on “Get Started” in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Go to the two step verification page and click Get Started. This will take you through the two step verification set up process. First you will again need to click “Get Started”. Click Get Started. Then you will be required to enter your password to confirm that it really is you trying to step two step verification. Enter your password. You will be asked to input your phone number. This is the phone number that will receive the text message every time you input your password and try to log in. This should be for your personal phone that you will have with you when you want to log in to your Chromebook. You won’t be able to log in without your phone after you set this up. Enter the phone number of the phone you will use for two step verification. Once you input your phone number, you will get a text message with a 6 digit number. Take this code and type it in to the next screen to confirm that you have the right phone number set up for two step verification. Enter your verification code to confirm your phone. After confirming both your password and your phone number you will be given the option to turn on two factor verification. You can do this by clicking “Turn On” on the next window. Turn on two factor authentication. Once this is turned on you can turn it back off by going through the same steps as before and then clicking “Turn Off” on the next screen. You can turn off two factor verification by clicking Turn Off. Finally, once you have enabled two step verification, you will need to have your phone with you every time you log in to your computer. This is good for security purposes, but will cause problems if you lose or replace your phone. Make sure you turn this feature back off if you are planning on getting a new phone. 8.0.5 Managing apps and devices You can monitor and manage which apps and devices have access to your account information from your account security page at https://myaccount.google.com/security. You should check this information periodically (every month or so at least) to see if there are any events or activity that you don’t recognize. If anyone has gotten access to your password or log in information, you will be able to see here when they have logged into your account. Your account security page. First you can see any security events that have occurred. Security events can be found by looking under “Device activity &amp; security events” in the section “Recent Security Events”. This will give you information on when your passwords are changed or when you have turned on or off two step verification. Your security events tell you about when your password or two step verification settings have changed. You can also see all the devices that have logged in to your Google account under “Device activity &amp; security events” in the section “Recently used devices”. You will see the Chromebook you are currently working on, but you will also see any Android phones you have logged in to or other computers where you signed into your account. Your recently used devices tells you what devices have logged into your account. As we have discussed in other sections, all of the software running on your Chromebook will be either Chrome Apps or Extensions or Android apps. For a lot of this software you will use Google to log in. That way you don’t have to have a separate password for each app and website. But each time you do this, you give the app a little bit of your information. When you stop using an app you may no longer want them to have access to your information. You can look and see which apps have access to your Google information by looking under “Apps with Account Access” in the section “Apps with Access to your Account”. You can see which apps have access to your account. If you click on a particular app you can take away the permission of that app to use your Google information. It is a good idea to check these apps from time to time and remove those that you no longer need, so they don’t have access to your Google information anymore. You can remove access for specific apps by clicking on them. 8.0.6 Slides and Video Chromebook Security Slides "],["printing-with-a-chromebook.html", "Chapter 9 Printing with a Chromebook", " Chapter 9 Printing with a Chromebook A Chromebook is designed to mostly work with files and documents online. The same is true if you want to print documents from a Chromebook. To print a document you will need to have a printer that is connected to the same wifi network as your Chromebook. If it is your personal printer you will need to follow the instructions that came with your printer to connect it to the wifi. If it is a work computer, make sure that the person responsible for the printer has enabled wifi-based printing. You can then set up your Chromebook to print by first going to your avatar and clicking the settings icon as we have done before. Open your settings. You can then scroll down through all of the settings in the main menu until you see the word “Advanced”. Click on “Advanced” to see your more advanced settings including your printer settings. Click on advanced. You can scroll down again until you find the “Printing Settings” section and then click on “Printers”. Click on printers. On the next page you will be shown a list of available printers. If this is your first time setting up a printer there won’t be any available yet. Click “ADD PRINTER” to open the printer list. Click on ADD PRINTER. You will see a list of all the printers available on your current wifi network. You should make very sure that you are selecting the right printer name to match either your personal printer or your work printer. You may want to print something harmless the first time you print to be sure you have connected to the right printer. Find the name of the printer that you want and click the name, then “ADD” Click the name of the printer, then ADD to add the printer. You should then see the printer under the list of printers. You can click on the three dots next to the printer to remove it if you selected the wrong one. The printer is now ready to be used. To print something, navigate to a website, for example https://www.google.com/. Then you can use the command ctrl+p to print this page. Remember this means to hold the ctrl key and press p. You should come to the printing window. One option that is immediately available is for you to save the page to a pdf file on your local computer. This won’t print the file, but it can be a good way to get a pdf copy of a website onto your computer if you want to save it. ctrl+p opens the printing window, you can save the page as a pdf by clicking save. If you haven’t previously used a printer you will still need to do one more step to get ready to print. You can click on “Change” in the “Destination” section. ctrl+p opens the printing window, click on change to change the printing destination. Then you need to find the printer name again and click on it. This will make that the destination for your file to print to. Click on the name of your printer This will return you to the printing window where you will now see the printer listed under the destination. You can then click on the “Print” button to print your document. Click on Print to print the document This will send the file to your printer. One thing to note is that printing from a Chromebook can be tricky in some settings because if printers are behind security firewalls then they won’t appear among the options for you to print to. You may have to contact the person who manages printers to have them help set the printer up to be recognized by a Chromebook. 9.0.1 Slides and Video Printing with a Chromebook Slides "],["projecting-from-a-chromebook.html", "Chapter 10 Projecting from a Chromebook", " Chapter 10 Projecting from a Chromebook As a data scientist you will often be asked to give presentations on your findings to your employers, to your colleagues, or at workshops or conferences. So you will need to learn to connect your Chromebook to a projector. 10.0.1 Finding the right dongle You won’t be able to plug your Chromebook in directly to a projector. You will need an adapter - often informally called a “dongle” to connect from your computer to the input cord of the projector. To figure out what kind of dongle you need, you need to know both the type of projector input you will be using and what type of ports you have on your computer to plug your dongle into. The two main types of inputs for projectors are VGA and HDMI. You can figure it out by looking at the cable coming from the projector. Find out what kind of projector cable you will be using You will then need to figure out what ports you have available on your computer. For example, the type of Chromebook I’m writing this on is a Chromebook Plus from Samsung. My computer has a USB-C port for connecting external devices like printers. My Chromebook has a USB-C connector, but yours might be different. To find out what kind of ports you have on your Chromebook you can go to the website https://www.google.com/chromebook. Then click on “Find Yours”. Go to https://www.google.com/chromebook and click Find Yours You will need to search or scroll down to find the version of Chromebook that you have. Once you have found your style of Chromebook click on it. Find your style of Chromebook and click on it. This should bring you to a screen with different options for purchasing a Chromebook. Any of those websites will have information about your Chromebook, but we have found that BestBuy often has the most information about ports, so click on the BestBuy logo on the left hand side to see more information. Click on the BestBuy logo to see more information. On the BestBuy page you can scroll down until you see the section called “Features”. Look for the word “Port” to find the type of port you have. In this case it is a USB-C port. Find the type of port you have under Features. Once you know the type of port you have on your Chromebook and the type of connection the projector cable has you can get the right dongle. Sometimes the place you will be presenting has a dongle available, but it is better to have two dongles. For each dongle you want one end to plug into the appropriate port on your computer (in my case USB-C). One of the dongles should have a VGA connection on the other end and the other dongle should have an HDMI connection. Then you will be prepared to connect your Chromebook to the vast majority of projectors you will use. Get a projector with the port for your computer and a VGA and HDMI connection on the other end. 10.0.2 Projecting from your Chromebook If you have the appropriate dongle you are now ready to project from your Chromebook. First, connect the dongle to the projector cord. Then connect the other end of the dongle to the port on your computer. Connect the dongle to the projector cord and to the port on your Chromebook. When you do this you will see that a window appears that says “Extending screen to” and then the name of the display. You should click on this box to open the display settings. Click on the extend displays box to open your Displays settings. There are two ways that the projector and your laptop can be connected. Extended display means that the projected screen is like a second Desktop connected to the Desktop on your computer. So you can drag files from the screen on your laptop to the projected screen. Mirrored display means that exactly what is on your Desktop is displayed on the projector. Usually when you first connect a Chromebook to a projector it will extend the display. This means that if you open the Displays window by clicking on the extending displays box, it may appear on the projected screen but not on your Desktop! This is because you have extended your screen so you actually have two screens you are working with. Extended display gives you two screens so what appears on your Desktop may differ from what appears on the projector screen. Usually when presenting you want the same thing to appear on your Desktop screen and the projector screen. You can do this by changing the setting from “Extending Display” to “Mirrored Display”. First you need to get the Displays Window to your Desktop. You can move your cursor all the way off the left or right hand side of the screen while watching the projector screen. You will see the cursor move up to the projector screen and you can click on the Displays window, hold down, and drag the display back to your Desktop. Drag the displays window to your Desktop and click mirror displays. Then if you click mirror displays you will see that your Desktop and the projector show the same thing. Click the Mirror Displays box to mirror the displays. You are now corrected and ready to present! Mirrored displays show the same thing on your laptop as on the projector. Once displays are mirrored you see the same thing on the laptop and the remote version. In a future class we will go over the software for making and delivering data science presentations. 10.0.3 Slides and Video Projecting From a Chromebook Slides "],["useful-applications.html", "Chapter 11 Useful Applications", " Chapter 11 Useful Applications In previous lessons we have discussed how to download apps from the Chrome Web Store. Here we will discuss some Chrome web apps that may be useful for the course and where you can get them. None of these apps is essential, but they may be helpful for productivity or organization. These apps can all be accessed directly from your Internet browser, but sometimes it will make your life and work easier to have the app directly on your Chromebook. 11.0.1 Basecamp We’ve previously discussed Basecamp as a place where you and all your other team members can communicate about projects.

There are lots of other useful apps and as we go through the courses we will point out when there are apps that may be useful to help you speed your way through your work as a data scientist. 11.0.8 Slides and Video Useful Applications Slides "],["getting-help-with-a-chromebook.html", "Chapter 12 Getting Help with a Chromebook", " Chapter 12 Getting Help with a Chromebook Chromebooks have the advantage of being very simple. You are going to do almost everything through the Internet browser. This minimizes many issues that laptop computers had historically. However, there are still issues that you will run into from time to time. We’ll discuss them below and describe where you can find help for these problems. 12.0.1 Common Issues Common Chromebook Issues generally fall under one of the following categories: Operating Systems Issues Internet Connection Problems Google Account Login All of these issues are addressed among Google’s Chromebook help pages. Chromebook Support Page Below we’ll demonstrate how to step through finding answers among this documentation; however, a few good things to consider before going to the help documentation are: did I type that web address correctly? Am I getting this error because of a mistake I made? If it is, fix that mistake and move on! Have I restarted recently (within the past week or two)? If not, now may be a good time to consider restarting to see if the issue still exists. If restarting doesn’t work or you can’t find a mistake, it may be time to consult the Chromebook Support documentation. We’ll walk through how to do that below. 12.0.2 Chromebook Support In addition to addressing common issues above, Google has a place where Chromebook users can go for support. At https://support.google.com/chromebook, you can search for answers to questions others have already asked or ask new questions. For example, if you were struggling to connect to the Internet on your Chromebook, you could first click on ‘Connect your Chromebook’ among the list of help topics. Connect your Chromebook This will expand the list to expose a number of topics of interest.
